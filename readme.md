### Tired of comparing two `JSON` object by eyes, or you just want to know what's changes when a new object about to overrides the old one. Use this.

You can start by copying index.js whole file.

1. Put two objects you want to compare within `compareTwoObject()`.
2. You can get `activityLogArray` to see what's going on.

By configuring `scanObject()` or `readScannedObject()` ,you can get all keys from the object or values from the object.

You can also configure custom array instead of connecting with `#` or `/`.

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!
